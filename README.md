Is where we do the things.

 ### What do you triage
 
#### Pull Requests
* [PR] Put on project board 
 - across GitHub
 - Pull Request from other repositories
* [PR] (general case) - 
* [Issues] - post the comment to slack
* [Issues] - final result - effort - impact
* [Issues/PR] - Labels - type of request

* Do you need to resolve
 
* Requested to reviewers
 
 * Comments post reply 
   * Update on ticket w/ @mention
   
* Weekly roundup of triage - this exists in Project
